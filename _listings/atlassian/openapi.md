        dashboard item enables an app to add user-specific information to a user dashboard.
        Dashboard items are exposed to users as gadgets that users can add to their
        dashboards. For more information on how users do this, see [Adding and customizing
        gadgets](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/7AeiLQ).  \n  \nWhen an app creates
        a dashboard item it registers a callback to receive the dashboard item ID.
        The callback fires whenever the item is rendered or, where the item is configurable,
        the user edits the item. The app then uses this resource to store the item's
        content or configuration details. For more information on working with dashboard
        items, see [Building a dashboard item for a JIRA Connect add-on](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/guide-building-a-dashboard-item-for-a-jira-connect-add-on-33746254/)
