  description: 'To retrieve a list of your public and private hosted zones, send a
    GETrequest to the /2013-04-01/hostedzone resource. The response to this requestincludes
    a HostedZones child element for each hosted zone created by the currentAWS account.Amazon
    Route 53 returns a maximum of 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of
    hostedzones, you can use the maxitems parameter to list them in groups of up to
    100.The response includes four values that help navigate from one group of maxitemshosted
    zones to the next:                  MaxItems is the value specified for the maxitems
    parameterin the request that produced the current response.If the value of IsTruncated
    in the response is true, there are morehosted zones associated with the current
    AWS account.                   NextMarker is the hosted zone ID of the next hosted
    zone that isassociated with the current AWS account. If you want to list more
    hosted zones, makeanother call to ListHostedZones, and specify the value of theNextMarker
    element in the marker parameter. If IsTruncated is false, the NextMarker element
    isomitted from the response.If you''re making the second or subsequent call to
    ListHostedZones, theMarker element matches the value that you specified in themarker
